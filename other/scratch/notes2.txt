# one advantage of a block cipher is state size: you can get away with an 80-128 bit block size
#   - you can also use less rounds then a hash
# a stream cipher should have a block size twice the key
#   - at least 80 bits of key material implies at least 160 bits of state
# a hash function needs 256+ bits of state and lots of rounds

#h_1(m) || h_2(m) improves collision resistance
#h_2(h_1(m)) improves preimage resistance

# non-reversible cryptography will always be vulnerable to side channel analysis because of the information radiating in the form of heat when information is not preserved in the non-reversible circuit. Every non-reversibly evaluated xor gate leaks information in the form of heat.
