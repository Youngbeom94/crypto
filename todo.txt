----------    
# the most generic cipher is a gigantic fisher yates shuffle of all n-bit blocks
# for example, for a 4 bit cipher, there are 2 ** 4 = 16 different possible message blocks
# encryption would be as follows:
#   prepare a list containing each possible message block (for example: [0, 1, 2, ..., 14, 15])
#   shuffle the list according to the key (a psuedo random permutation of the list)
#   find your message in the list and output its location as the ciphertext
#
# decryption would be:
#   perform the list shuffle again
#   check for the index that the ciphertext block is moved back to
#   output that block/index as the plaintext

# or
# encryption:
#   apply a one-to-one first-preimage resistant function to the message to produce an ciphertext block

# decryption:
#   apply the inverse of function used during encryption



# keyed, one-to-one, first preimage resistant function
#   - second preimages and collisions not possible, because it is one-to-one/not compressing
# hard to find input, given output
# hard to find key, given only output

# find some other key that happens to produce the inverse mapping to the first key
# find some function that allows to find such a key faster then brute force
#   - but only if you have certain information

    
    
    
# for successive p_i where next_p >= this_p ** 2
# each p is a basis for a lattice
# + is the superposition operator (point(s) + point(s))
# * selects a point on the lattice (basis * point)
# modulo (aka "mod" and "%") removes the modulo-d basis from the superposition (superposition_of_points % basis)
# - (subtraction) removes some point(s) from the superposition (superposition_of_points - point(s))
# / (division) determines the point on the lattice (point / basis) ((p * q) / p == q)

# i.e.:
#   (p1 * q1) + (p2 * q2)
# q1 is a point on the p1 lattice
# q2 is a point on the p2 lattice
# the two are joined via the addition operator into a superposition of state
# while in this superposition, they may be manipulated independently as well as simultaneously
# points can be removed from the superposition if the basis are known
# it is simply a matter of performing superposition_of_points modulo basis
# i.e.:
#   ((p1 * q1) + (p2 * q2)) mod p1 == p2 * q2   # modulo removes p1 * q1 from the equation
#   ((p1 * q1) + (p2 * q2)) - (p2 * q2) == p1 * q1  # subtraction removes the previously acquired p2 * q2 from the superposition
# 
# modulo only requires a lattice basis (p)
# while subtraction requires some point on the lattice (p * q)
#   - or a superposition of points (p1 * q1 + p2 * q2 + ...)

# elements may be manipulated individually by using the basis to address to element
# for example:
#   q1 := 10
#   state := (p1 * q1) + (p2 * q2)
#   state += (p1 * 2) # increments the point on the p1 lattice by 2
#   state %= p2 # removes p2 from state
#   state /= p1 # recovers q1 from state
#   state == 12

Given $p1, p2$ and a sum $sum := p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2$, how hard is it to recover any of: $q_1, q_2, q_1 + q_2$
    - $p1, p2$ are approximately the same size in bits 
    - $p1, p2$ are psuedorandom values, while $q_1 and q_2$ are independently generated random values
    
Right now, the size of each $p_i$ is about 1060 bits. 
The size of each $q_i$ is 256 bits.    
    - The $q_i$ may need to be a lot larger then then $p_i$; But until I understand why, I do not know what else to set it to

    
if p1q1 + p2q2 is easy to invert, then we can create ciphertexts that take the form of plaintext
if p1q1 + p2q2 is hard to invert, then we use it for public key crypto


# subset sum problem
# 2 elements are summed from a huge set
# from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem
#> If N (the number of variables) is small, then an exhaustive search for the solution is practical. If P (the number of place values) is a small fixed number, then there are dynamic programming algorithms that can solve it exactly.
#
# huge set size makes exhaustive search impractical
# huge set is generated via multiplication of large numbers
#   - results in large sum of varying size
  
  
  
  
modular stuff

# if p == n - 1, then p == modular_inverse(p, n)
# also, p == n - 1 is not vulnerable to gcd
# x * (n - 1) mod n reverses the set of elements  0, 1, 2, ... n

# x * y mod n
# produces pairs that add up to n at opposite ends
# n = 10
# x = 7

# x * (n - 2) mod n is equivalent to 2n - 2x
# x * (n - y) mod n is equivalent to yn - yx
# x * (n + y) mod n is equivalent to yn + yx

# additive inverse of x mod n == x * (n - 1) mod n            x + y == 0

# exponential inverse of x mod n == tetrate(x, n - 1) mod n   x ** y == 1
#   - incorrect?
#   tetrate(x, n - 1, n) yields either 1 or x
#       - yields 1 if x is even

k * m mod P creates a permutation of P elements

[(k * m) % P for m in range(P)]

0 is a fixed point

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[0, 3, 1, 4, 2] # k = 3

if a random ordering of set(range(P)) is shuffled by k, can k be determined, given only the shuffled set?

[0, 3, 1, 4, 2] # a "random" ordering
[0, 4, 3, 2, 1] # after shuffling according to k = 3

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] # a "random" ordering
[0, 4, 3, 2, 1] # after shuffling according to k = 5

Multiple k could have produced the shuffled set.
Each possible value of k could have produced the shuffled set, and each has a corresponding initial ordering.
If the initial ordering can be guessed with any probability better then random, then the design will leak key information.

The initial ordering is produced by (k2 * r) + m % P, which is at most equal to P - 1
Assuming m is constant, the distribution is determined by k2: k2 will be the difference between two successive items

The distribution is determined by (k * k2 * i) % P for i in range(P)
The difference between successive i is equivalent to k * k2
i are not generated in order; they are drawn randomly from the available space

generate many encryptions of 0
take the difference between many pairs
compute gcd of many such differences
compute gcd of gcds
factor obtained element to obtain k2
use k2 to learn initial ordering
use knowledge of initial ordering to recover k

#      + password still protects keys even if a device is compromised
#           ! could password protect device token, so that even if device is compromised device token is secure as password

#               + could use additional per-device password to protect device token
#      + device token protects keys even if password is compromised
#   - must download keys anonymously to avoid association of a user with a set of encrypted keys
#       - negative point because it takes time, and could be complicated to implement successfully in practice
#       - If this is not done, it is obvious what device a set of keys belongs to
#   + adversary cannot test password guesses unless they compromise users device AND know which keys are associated with the device
#       - If a device is compromised, then adversary can test password guesses...
#           + ... *if* they know which set of encrypted keys belongs to the targeted user
#               -> keys are downloaded anonymously

#                       -> adversary cannot test password guesses
#   -> To test a guessed password, the adversary must:
#       -> de-anonymize traffic to find the associated set of encrypted keys to obtain the password verifier
#           -> compromise the device associated with that particular set of keys to obtain the device token
#               -> Then they may begin to guess the users password


# when a new authentication token for a service is needed: create a random 32 character password and store it on the device
# + no additional password to remember
# + secure against cracking without the need for slow hashing
# + store encrypted on device when not in use
#   -> crypto provider options: master password, device password, device token, device password + token, master password + device password + device token
# - lost device -> lost ability to authenticate to service
#    -> Cancel old device token and register new token 
#        + this is better UX then a password change -> only have to remember master password
#            - master password is hashed very slowly -> it takes real time before a new password can be generated

chess as a one way function
given a board configuration, it appears hard to find the sequence of moves that resulted in the configuration                                                                    



# password hashing
# goal: large latency when processing hash, regardless of number of available parallelism or computing power
# problems: Adversary has significantly better funding + hardware then honest users
# usual solution: 
#   - Design an algorithm that runs at optimal efficiency on a general purpose CPU
#       - now specialized hardware provides no real advantage
#           - for *now*, specialized hardware may provide smaller advantage
#               - but the password need to be secure for the future, not just now
#       - assuming there exists a algorithm that runs optimally on a general purpose CPU...
#           - the adversaries CPU clock still runs much faster then an honest users does
# other souces of latency:
#   - network latency
#       - only usable if adversary does not have access to password verifier

"Minicrypt: One-way functions exist but we do not have public-key cryptography."

We can create a random-walk/key-agreement cryptosystem via iterating an arbitrary function
    - assuming that the function is deterministic, then correctness of the shared value is guaranteed            
    - different functions offer different levels of relationships:
        - all provide addition 
        - some provide multiplication as well as addition    
    - not all functions are secure
        - security requires:
            - "hard" to obtain the number of function iterations k given the output of successive applications of the function via f_k(f_k-1(f_k-2(...(f_0(g)))))
                - not sufficient for security
                    - knowledge of k may not be required to produce the shared value for 2 public keys
            - "hard"/not possible to use 2 public keys to produce the corresponding shared secret (without knowing k)
            - "efficiently" shortcut-able
                - Otherwise can only obtain a level of security proportionate to how many iterations are applied
                    - adversary has more computing power
                        - no shortcut = no security
                        
Given a One-Way Function:
    - if it is not efficiently shortcut-able, then key agreement via it is not (securely) possible
        - if it is efficiently shortcut-able, then:
            - prove that it is hard to obtain the number of function iterations k, given the output of successive function applications
                - i.e. the discrete logarithm problem 
            - prove that it is hard to use 2 public keys without the corresponding private keys to arrive at the shared secret
            
            if both can be proven, then key agreement is possible using the One-Way Function
                - then minicrypt == cryptomania and public key cryptography exists

g^-x is the modular multiplicative inverse of g^x
g^-x * g^x = g^(x - x) = g^0 = 1
(pow(g, p - 1 - x, p) * pow(g, x, p)) % p == 1

     
     
draw the sigma(choice) symbol 

     
     
inverse(x, p * q) == inverse(x, p) + (p * r) == inverse(x, q) + (q * r)
  - factoring? AGCD?
inverse(x, p * q) mod q == inverse(x, q)
