\section{First section}

Meet Bob and Alice. Bob and Alice are pen pals; they write letters to each other, and send them through the mail. Additionally, we will introduce Eve:  Eve has no respect for others, as well as a pathological need to try and do wrong; She is not opposed to lying, cheating, and stealing, and is very creative in this arts. She will go to great length to do these things if she thinks it will benefit her; Even when there is no real benefit to her, she will do such things whenever she can get away with it, simply because she can.

Unfortunately, Eve is the mail carrier. Fortunately, Bob and Alice are aware of Eve's nature, and they seek to find ways of communicating with each other without Eve interfering. In order to do so, they need to enumerate all of the ways that Eve could abuse their communications, and develop appropriate counter-measures.

\subsection{Lying, Cheating, and Stealing}

The first and most obvious concern is Eve opening and reading the messages that are exchanged between Bob and Alice.

Second, and slightly more devious, is that Eve could manipulate messages sent between the two.

Third, Eve actually does not have to wait for Bob to actually send a letter to Alice. She can simply write her own letter, put Bob's name on it, and deliver it to Alice.

Fourth, she could withhold or make copies of messages, and save them for delivery at some other arbitrary point in time.

Finally, Eve could simply choose not to deliver the messages at all.

\subsection{Solutions}




For example, Bob might send Alice a christmas card with money inside, and a note that says "I am sending you \$20; I hope you have a nice holiday". Upon opening this, Eve could simply take the money, and leave a new note in the card that say "Sorry, I can't afford gifts this year; I hope you have a nice holiday anyways. PS: Please send me some money". Then she could easily repeat this process.
