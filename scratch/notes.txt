# asymmetric crypto built on exploiting rules/relationships like commutativity and distribution?
# - The goal for how to break the cipher is usually well defined (i.e factor the modulus)
# - security based on size of numbers involved 
#    - Key size is selected by placing it outisde of the capabilities of the best known algorithms for solving the problem in question (i.e. factoring)

# symmetric crypto obscures and removes any usable relationship of the data
# - Key size usually set to 128 to 256 bits
#   - Key size determined by how long it would take to brute force the key (exponential problem)
# - The question of how to break the algorithm is usually not well defined
#   - There are generic attack frameworks such as linear and differential cryptanalysis
#       - Security against these based on number of rounds * resistance of each round to attack
#       - Establish resistance of one round against attacks:
#           - low differential probabilities are desirable (DDT)
#               - beware impossible differentials
#           - low linearity/high non-linearity is desirable (high minimum distance from linear function)(LAT)
#           - Higher active bits (or bytes) is better (truncated differential cryptanalysis)
#       - Multiply rounds until attack becomes infeasible
#   - Slide attacks
#       - Exploits similarity between rounds
#       - Defeat by using round constants or a large enough block size

# certain features are more appropriate for ciphers that use small/large register sets
