a one-way function:
    - is difficult to invert
        - given y, it is difficult to obtain x
    - is first preimage resistant
        - it is hard to find the specific input x which produced a given output y
    - is second preimage resistant
        - There exist multiple possible x that could produce y 
        - it is hard to find any input other then x that produces identical output to input x
    - is collision resistant
        - it is hard to find any two distinct inputs x and y which produce an identical output z
    
unpredictable means:
    - output cannot be guessed without calculating the function for a given input
    - differential and linear probabilities and round count can influence this
    
uniformly random means:
    - output is computationally indstinguishable from random data
    - differential and linear probabilities and round count can influence this
    
a function prp(x) ^ x:
    - assuming prp(x) produces unpredictable, uniformly random output, then prp(x) ^ x:
        - produces uniformly random output
            - proof: the combination of random data + data is at least as random as the random data
        
            - assuming x is large enough   
            
                - proof: prp(x) ^ x produces unpredictable, uniformly random output and is not a bijection
                    - would have to guess random search space or input space x
        - is first preimage resistant:        
            - proof: difficult to invert (given y, it is difficult to obtain x)  
        - is second preimage resistant:    
            - y = prp(x) ^ x is not a bijection (not a permutation/not invertible)                      
            - proof: y = prp(x) ^ x is both difficult to invert and output is random            
        - is collision resistant:        
            - proof: the output of prp(x) ^ x is unpredictable and uniformly random             
        
        - acts like a one-way function
    
a trapdoor one-way function:
    - is difficult to invert without a particular piece of information
    - becomes a bijection (invertible) with the piece of information
