Ella's Crypto Research

This repository contains code for cryptanalysis:
    
    - Testing a permutation for the minimum number of active bits (truncated differential cryptanalysis)    
    - A metrics library for performing statistical tests of hash functions, block ciphers, stream ciphers, and permutations
    - Linear/Differential cryptanalysis of S-boxes
    
as well as various designs for:
    
    - hash functions
    - stream ciphers
    - block ciphers
    - PRPs
    - secret key based public key encryption
    - secret sharing
    - slow hashing
    - proof of work
    - computationally asymmetric encryption/decryption
        
The analysis tools are written in python, as well the designs. A few designs have variants written in C to get a better understanding of algorithm performance on the CPU.
Most of the designs are my own and are not intended for use to protect data in the real world. The code is for research purposes.
