# crypto
cryptographic primitives

This repository contains code for cryptanalysis, as well as various test designs for hash functions, stream ciphers, block ciphers, and psuedo-random permutations

The analysis tools are written in python, as well as most of the designs. A few designs have variants written in C to get a better understanding of algorithm performance on the CPU.
